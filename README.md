This project is a Gmail automation script developed as part of a technical assignment for the Technical Lead â€“ Backend role at HappyFox.

It performs the following:
- Authenticates via OAuth2 with the Gmail API
- Fetches and stores emails in an SQLite3 database
- Applies rules defined in a `rules.json` configuration file
- Executes Gmail actions like marking emails as read or moving them to labels

The codebase is structured for long-term maintainability, readability, and reusability.
